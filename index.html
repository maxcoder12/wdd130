            Hello, my name is Maximo. I am 20 years old and I am from Venezuela, but I live in Gramado, Brazil. I came here when I was seventeen years old.
            I have met programming since my sixteen years, and I have loved and enjoy programming since that. I am so excited to be enrolled in this course, so 
            I can improve my skills and gain more knowledge about HTML5 and CSS. I am member of The Church of Jesus Christ, and I served as a missionary in Rio de Janeiro South Mission.
            Now, I am working at a pizza factory and pursuing an education to get a better and more profitable job to care of my future family.

            My city, Gramado, is a beautiful town in the south of Brazil, known for its architecture 
            inspired in Germany or Europe. Gramado has a cool climate, and many attractions. It is located 
            in a region called Serra GaÃºcha, some nice places in Gramado are the Lago Negro and the Mini Mundo, 
            and also hosts popular events such as Natal Luz and the Gramado Film Festival. My town is famous for fondue, 
            artisanal chocolates, and cafÃ©s.I feel Gramado like a slice of Europe in Brazil.
