            Hello, my name is Maximo. I am 20 years old and I am from Venezuela, but I live in Gramado, Brazil. I came here when I was seventeen years old.
            I have met programming since my sixteen years, and I have loved and enjoy programming since that. I am so excited to be enrolled in this course, so 
            I can improve my skills and gain more knowledge about HTML5 and CSS. I am member of The Church of Jesus Christ, and I served as a missionary in Rio de Janeiro South Mission.
            Now, I am working at a pizza factory and pursuing an education to get a better and more profitable job to care of my future family.
        </p>

            My city, Gramado, is a beautiful town in the south of Brazil, known for its architecture 
            inspired in Germany or Europe. Gramado has a cool climate, and many attractions. It is located 
            in a region called Serra GaÃºcha.
