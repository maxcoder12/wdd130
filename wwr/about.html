            <p>Founded in 1995, <strong>Rapids</strong> started with a simple mission: to share the thrill and beauty of river rafting with adventure seekers from all walks of life. Our journey began on the rugged banks of the Colorado River, where a small group of passionate outdoor enthusiasts recognized the potential for offering guided trips through its stunning rapids and serene wilderness. What started as a weekend activity for friends soon grew into a full-fledged business, as word spread about the unique combination of excitement and natural beauty that our rafting trips provided.</p>
